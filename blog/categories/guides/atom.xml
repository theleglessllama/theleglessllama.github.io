    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We are using <strong>Markdown</strong> for the overall script, and <span class="math">\(LaTeX\)</span> for typesetting equations, chemicals and those technical shebang.</p>
<p>What for? Well,</p>
<ul>
<li>We won’t be dependent on a certain system (be it Microsoft Word, Google Docs, Pages etc). They all have different formats, and conversion is painful as hell.</li>
<li>This means that you can <strong>write on anything</strong>. Be it Notepad, TextEdit, Sublime, EMacs or your favorite word processor, they’re all the same to us since all we care about is the word, not formatting</li>
<li>This also helps you to <strong>focus</strong>, since you only need to be concerned with the <em>text</em>, and not the <em>formatting</em></li>
</ul>
<p>But what does this trouble translate into?</p>
<ul>
<li>Render the script into <strong>transcripts</strong> for filming easily</li>
<li><strong>Displaying</strong> the scripts online</li>
<li>Process these scripts into <strong>notes</strong> beautifully</li>
<li><strong>Archive</strong> the scripts conveniently</li>
</ul>
<p>With that, let’s begin!</p>
<h2 id="editor-choice">Editor Choice</h2>
<p>Markdown and <span class="math">\(LaTeX\)</span> can be written anywhere. So long as you have any basic text editor, it should work. We recommend Sublime Text.</p>
<p>However, you’d only see the “source code” of the file. You won’t see the finished product. If you’re the kind that likes to see that side by side, then here’s what you do.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Go to Google Drive</li>
<li>Click on “Create” as if you were going to create a new document</li>
<li>If you see a button titled “Stackedit”, click on it. If you don’t, here’s how you get it.
<ul>
<li>Click on “Connect more apps”</li>
<li>Search for “Stackedit”</li>
<li>Click on “Connect”</li>
<li>Check “Make StackEdit the default app for files it can open”</li>
<li>Click on “OK”</li>
<li>Now go back and click on “Create” again. You should see “Stackedit”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This is basically a side by side editing tool that allows you to see the code you type on the left, and the finished product on the right.</li>
</ol>
<p>Cool right?</p>

<h3 id="sample-script">Sample Script</h3>
<p>This is a redacted version of a chemistry script.</p>
<pre><code>---
subject: Chemistry
topic: Atoms and Molecules
lesson: Moles, Mass, and Number of Particles

## Moles and Avogadro’s Number

&lt;1&gt; Whenever you get some eggs from the supermarket, you usually get half a dozen, a dozen, or if you’re really hungry, two dozen instead of asking for 4 eggs or 3 eggs or 9 eggs. A dozen eggs is 12 eggs, and we use this special unit out of habit.

In chemistry, we use another special unit to describe how many atoms of an element that we have. It is called a &lt;2&gt; mole, which represents &lt;3&gt; $6.022 \times 10^{23}$ atoms. A mole of hydrogen for example, contains 6.022 times ten raised to the 23 hydrogen atoms. &lt;4&gt; $6.022 \times 10^{23}$ is known as Avogadro’s number. Moles and the number of particles in a mole are important when it comes to controlling reactions. If I had to react sodium and water to make an explosion, I would control &lt;5&gt; how big the explosion would be by controlling the moles of sodium, aka the number of sodium atoms, to add to the water. 

## Molecular Weight aka Molar Mass

&lt;1&gt; Let’s say you have a donut made of two things: &lt;2&gt; cream and flour. We can find the donut mass by adding the mass of the flour in the donut to the mass of of the cream on the donut. Let’s say the flour has a mass of 20 g and creme has a mass of 10 g. Then, one donut has a mass of 30 g. 

In a similar way, we can find the mass of molecules. Let’s look at the water molecule. &lt;3&gt; We know that it is composed of two hydrogen atoms and a single oxygen atom, or $\ce{H2O}$. To find the molecular weight of water, we take the atomic mass of each element making up the molecule, and add them all together.</code></pre>
<h3 id="header">Header</h3>
<p>First, you’ll see the Subject, Topic, and Lesson of the checkpoint at the top sandwiched by dashed lines <code>---</code>.</p>
<pre><code>---
subject: Chemistry
topic: Atoms and Molecules
lesson: Moles, Mass, and Number of Particles
---</code></pre>
<p>This is really self explanatory. Just type it in as it is.</p>
<h3 id="checkpoint-title">Checkpoint Title</h3>
<p>Each checkpoint title should have <strong>two hashes</strong> in front like this <code>## Checkpoint Title</code> followed by a <strong>line break</strong>. This tells Markdown that this should be a Heading.</p>
<p>Hence, for the checkpoint titled <strong>Moles and Avogadro’s Number</strong>, it begins with this line.</p>
<pre><code>### Moles and Avogadro’s Number
</code></pre>
<h3 id="checkpoint-content">Checkpoint Content</h3>
<p>Then comes the content of the checkpoint. Just type them in, with a double paragraph break separating paragraphs.</p>
<p>So this is <strong>good</strong>.</p>
<pre><code>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam.

Quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor.</code></pre>
<p>This is <strong>bad</strong> and a whole lot harder to read.</p>
<pre><code>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam.
Quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor.</code></pre>
<p>Save your eyes.</p>
<h3 id="slide-markers">Slide Markers</h3>
<p>You’ll find stuff like this <code>&lt;1&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;2&gt;</code> in the scripts. Fret not. They are simply markers for the slide maker. In other words, after you write a script, you’ll be drawing the animations on a storyboard. These tell the slide maker to match the slide numbers drawn with the script position. This helps the animators to time the slides.</p>
<p>If you see them added already, simply ignore them.</p>
<p><strong>With this, you should be able to draft a set of slides on English Literature</strong>.</p>
<p>However, we are working with subjects like Mathematics and Chemistry. They require strange notation like <span class="math">\(\frac{3}{4}\)</span> that you don’t want to just leave as 3/4. Why not? Ugly. And ugly stuff belong in hell, not in our documents.</p>
<p>Enter <span class="math">\(LaTeX\)</span> (pronounced Laa-Tech)</p>
<h2 id="cross-subject">Cross Subject</h2>
<h3 id="basics">Basics</h3>
<p>There are two types of equations you are going to write. Stuff that appears within a paragraph like <span class="math">\(3x = 9 + 7y\)</span> here. These are called <strong>inline equations</strong>, since they appear <em>in the line</em> with the paragraph text.</p>
<p>To do that, simply insert the equation between two dollar signs. Like so <code>$3x = 9 + 7y$</code>. This will give the exact same thing as above. Make sure that there are no spaces to the right of the first <code>$</code>, or to the left of the second <code>$</code>. So <code>$ 3x = 9 + 7y $</code> won’t work. When it’s being rendered, Markdown will throw you all sorts of errors.</p>
<p>There’s another type here. We want to prove that no three positive integers <span class="math">\(a\)</span>, <span class="math">\(b\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(c\)</span> (<span class="math">\(a\)</span>, <span class="math">\(b\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(c\)</span>, were typed using <strong>inline equations</strong> by the way) can satisfy this equation</p>
<p><span class="math">\[a^n + b^n = c^n\]</span></p>
<p>for any integer value of <span class="math">\(n&gt;2\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now this equation appears right smack in the middle right? That’s what we call <strong>display</strong> equations. They’re typed using two <code>$</code>s instead of one. So, to produce that, I simply typed <code>$$a^n + b^n = c^n$$</code></p>
<p>So to type that entire paragraph, I will type</p>
<pre><code>There&#39;s another type here. We want to prove that no three positive integers $a$, $b$, and $c$ ($a$, $b$, and $c$, were typed using **inline equations** by the way) can satisfy this equation 

$$a^n + b^n = c^n$$

for any integer value of $n&gt;2$.</code></pre>
<p>Cool right?</p>
<h2 id="mathematics">Mathematics</h2>
<p>Feel free to replace the <strong>inline</strong> with <strong>display</strong> notation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Superscript and subscript are done using <code>^</code> and <code>_</code> characters. Note that if you want multiple characters in the super/subscript then you need to surround them with curly braces: <code>$e^i\pi = -1$</code> gives <span class="math">\(e^i\pi = -1\)</span> whereas <code>$e^{i\pi} = -1$</code> gives <span class="math">\(e^{i\pi} = -1\)</span>.</li>
<li>Fractions are done using <code>$\frac{1}{2}$</code> which gives <span class="math">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span>.</li>
<li>To do a binomial coefficient, use <code>$\binom{n}{k}$</code> which gives <span class="math">\(\binom{n}{k}\)</span>.</li>
<li><span class="math">\(\forall\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\exists\)</span> are written as <code>$\forall$</code> and <code>$\exists$</code>.</li>
<li><span class="math">\(\neq\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\geq\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(\leq\)</span> are <code>$\neq$</code>, <code>$\geq$</code>, and <code>$\leq$</code>.</li>
<li><span class="math">\(\cdot\)</span> (e.g. for multiplication) is <code>$\cdot$</code>.</li>
<li><span class="math">\(\circ\)</span> is <code>$\circ$</code>.</li>
<li><span class="math">\(\cup\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\cap\)</span> are <code>$\cup$</code> and <code>$\cap$</code>.</li>
<li><span class="math">\(\oplus\)</span> is written with <code>$\oplus$</code>.</li>
<li>Large <span class="math">\(\cup\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\cap\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\oplus\)</span> signs that behave like summations (see below for summations) are written as <code>$\bigcup$</code>, <code>$\bigcap$</code>, <code>$\bigoplus$</code>.</li>
<li><span class="math">\(\{\}\)</span> are done with <code>\{</code> and <code>\}</code>.</li>
<li><span class="math">\(\approx\)</span> is produced with <code>$\approx$</code>.</li>
<li><span class="math">\(\hat{x}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\bar{x}\)</span> are done with <code>\hat{x}</code> and <code>\bar{x}</code>. A longer bar may be written using <code>\overline{abcd}</code>, which produces <span class="math">\(\overline{defg}\)</span>.</li>
<li>Greek characters are simply what they are. For example, capital Delta <span class="math">\(\Delta\)</span> is simply <code>$\Delta$</code> while lower case delta <span class="math">\(\delta\)</span> is simply <code>$\delta$</code>.</li>
<li>The probability sign is defined as <code>$\Pr$</code>, i.e. <span class="math">\(\Pr\)</span>.</li>
<li>To draw parentheses that grow to match the contents, use <code>$\left$</code> to precede the left parenthesis and <code>$\right$</code> to precede the right:<br />Source: <code>$$\Pr\left[\sum_{i=1}^k X_i &gt; c \right] \leq 2^{-\Omega(c^2 k)}$$</code> Output:</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math">\[\Pr\left[\sum_{i=1}^k X_i &gt; c \right] \leq 2^{-\Omega(c^2 k)}\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Summations and products are done using <code>$\sum$</code> and <code>$\prod$</code> respectively. Parameters can be given for the summation/product as well: Source: <code>$$\sum_{i=1}^\infty \frac{1}{2^i} = 1$$</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Output:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\sum_{i=1}^\infty \frac{1}{2^i} = 1\]</span></p>
<h2 id="chemistry">Chemistry</h2>
<ul>
<li>Chemical equations can be done using the command <code>$\ce{whatever chemical}$</code>. For example, to show the chemical <span class="math">\(\ce{NaCl}\)</span>, just type <code>$\ce{NaCl}$</code>.
<ul>
<li>In short, <span class="math">\(\ce{NaCl}\)</span> can be typed using <code>$\ce{NaCl}$</code></li>
<li>Ions like <span class="math">\(\ce{Na^+}\)</span> or <span class="math">\(\ce{Cl^-}\)</span> can be typed with a simple <strong>superscript</strong> like <code>$\ce{Na^+}$</code> or <code>$\ce{Cl^-}$</code></li>
<li>Reaction equations can be typed by literally drawing out the right arrow <code>-&gt;</code>. Hence <span class="math">\(\ce{Ag^+ + Cl^- -&gt; AgCl}\)</span> can be typeset using <code>$\ce{Ag^+ + Cl^- -&gt; AgCl}$</code></li>
<li>State symbols can be typed using <code>(s)</code> or <code>(aq)</code>. So <span class="math">\(\ce{Ag^+(aq) + Cl^-(aq) -&gt; AgCl (s)}\)</span> is typed using <code>$\ce{Ag^+(aq) + Cl^-(aq) -&gt; AgCl (s)}$</code></li>
<li>Reversible reactions like <span class="math">\(\ce{2NaCl + CaCO3 &lt;=&gt; Na2CO3 + CaCl2}\)</span> is produced from <code>$\ce{2NaCl + CaCO3 &lt;=&gt; Na2CO3 + CaCl2}$</code></li>
<li>If you’re the fancy type that likes to add little things on top of reaction arrows like this <span class="math">\(\ce{-&gt;C[I-]}\)</span> then do it like this <code>$\ce{-&gt;C[I-]}$</code>. This works too <span class="math">\(\ce{&lt;=&gt;C[+e]}\)</span> from <code>$\ce{&lt;=&gt;C[+e]}$</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Typing units can be a pain in the ass. I mean who wants to type <span class="math">\(ms^{-1}\)</span> all the time like <code>$ms^{-1}$</code>. Don’t you wish you could just type <strong>SI Units</strong>? Besides, the <em>italics</em> makes it kind of ugly. Fortunately, there’s a way.
<ul>
<li><span class="math">\(5 \si{\metre\per\second}\)</span> can be typeset using <code>$5 \si{\metre\per\second}$</code></li>
<li>The rest of the SI units work as well. Experiment, or look up the guide here <a href="http://mirror.utexas.edu/ctan/macros/latex/contrib/siunitx/siunitx.pdf">http://mirror.utexas.edu/ctan/macros/latex/contrib/siunitx/siunitx.pdf</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="final-tips">Final Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>Do not leave any equations in plain text. That is plain ugly.</li>
<li>If the Stackedit preview fails to render, or produces weird shit, you’re probably making a mistake somewhere (most likely a missing or additional <code>$</code> sign).</li>
<li>Once you get used to this, you’ll never go back.</li>

<p>Number of the video in the playlist, followed by the title of the video. e.g. <em>1 Why Rebut</em> for <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5oW1ofFRgs">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5oW1ofFRgs</a></p>
<p>For example, <code>1 Demand Curve.txt</code></p>
<p>Text File Contents:</p>
<pre><code>So now before I bore you with the things like

demand curve, supply curve,

consumer surplus and producer surplus,

let’s go into something simpler.

Everyone knows cookies.

You know cookie I know cookie,

I have a pack of cookies here.

Let’s say that the pack of cookies cost five dollars.

Now if it’s five dollars and you say:

&quot;Hey the cookies are a little bit expensive,

I can’t afford that many cookies.

I’m just going to buy one pack of cookies.&quot;

So great. Imagine a graph.

The vertical axis being the price.

The horizontal axis being the quantity.

So what you do is that,

I say at 5 dollars, I buy one pack of cookies.

Now if I drop the price to 4 dollars,

Now 4 dollars I say:

&quot;Hey maybe I can buy a little bit more cookies,

maybe my mom wants it,

maybe I want to eat a little bit more&quot;,

so you say I buy two packets.

If I lower the price a little bit more,

and I lower it to 3 dollars, I say:

&quot;3 dollars. Right I’ll buy even more cookies&quot;,

so I’ll buy three packets.

I lower it to 2 dollars, you buy 4 packets.

I lower it to 1 dollar, you buy 5 packets.

Now, what you see happening is that on the graph,

you have 5 dots.

And these dots basically show the relationship

between the price and the quantity.

So in the next checkpoint,

you will see how these points

can be joined together to form the demand curve.</code></pre>]]></content>

<li>e.g. “The explanation of this theory can be made in this manner” vs. “You can explain it this way.”</li>
<li>Then make it even simpler</li>
<li>e.g. “This is why.”</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="make-fun-of-stuff">Make fun of stuff</h2>
<ul>
<li>Statement + Because + Sarcastic Statement
<ul>
<li>Difficult names: “Chebyshev Polynomials, because clearly ‘polynomials’ weren’t already difficult enough to pronounce”.</li>
<li>“We’re going to calculate how long it would take a box to fall to the ground if it were pushed out of the plane, because we’re totally to need to know that tomorrow”.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Make fun of yourself
<ul>
<li>Because that’s the one person whom you can be sure not to offend.</li>
<li>e.g. “Someone who’s lazy like me will prefer this method”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Make fun of examiners
<ul>
<li>Because that’s everyone’s common enemy</li>
<li>e.g. “The examiner will ask you how many miles you ran. Now that’s not really his business, but they always ask you stupid things. So just answer him.”</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-script-not-lecture-notes">A script, not lecture notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Add a pre.g.ant pause after every question
<ul>
<li>“What’s the algorithm for the Runge-Kutta method for differential equations?” <em>pause for 2 seconds</em> “Fall to your knees and pray baby, pray.”</li>
<li>“Who’s the sexiest man on earth?” <em>pause for 2 seconds</em> “Why, Linan, of course.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Don’t sound like a textbook
<ul>
<li>So don’t use textbook language</li>
<li>e.g. “Note that this theorem is…” vs “Be careful! This theorem is…”</li>
<li>e.g. “Given these assumptions, we can proceed with our derivation.” vs “We know that these are our assumptions. So let’s proceed!”</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="vary-your-sentence-length">Vary your sentence length</h2>
<ul>
<li>If every sentence was as long as this one, reading it would be a total pain in the ass - imagine: you’d have to make it through the entire thing on one single breath, and after that you’d still have to process it. Now take that previous sentence and use your marvelous imagination to predict how it would look like if you were reading out a hundred of them in a row and someone were listening to it all the way - you’re going to sound like a balmy old professor who has not been listened to for the past three decades of his life.</li>
<li>See that above? Give it a read through and you’ll find that it’s bad. Really bad. It’s not so much about the actual content as it is about the length and monotonicity of the sentences. The simplest way to fix it is to keep sentences short if possible, and make them long only when you need them! Easy peasy!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="vary-punctuation">Vary punctuation</h2>
<ul>
<li>A lecturer sees “!” very differently from “.”, and will read them accordingly.</li>
<li>e.g. “This is the end of the lecture.” vs. “This is the end of the lecture!”</li>
</ul>]]></content>

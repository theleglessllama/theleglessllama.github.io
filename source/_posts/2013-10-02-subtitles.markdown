## Style Guide

-   Single space after periods. e.g. *Lorem ipsum sit. Dolor amet.* not
    *Lorem ipsum sit. Dolor amet.*

-   Single space after commas. e.g. *Lorem ipsum sit, dolor amet.* not
    *Lorem ipsum sit, dolor amet.*

-   All "I" should be capitalized. First letters of sentences should be
    capitalized.

-   Capitalization for speeches should be done correctly. e.g. *She
    said, “Hello!”* not *She said, “hello!”*.

-   Punctuation for speeches should be done correctly, specifically the
    correct use of open quotes and close quotes. e.g. *She said,
    “Hello!”* not *She said, "Hello!"*.

-   Technical terms should be capitalized. e.g. *The Demand Curve is a
    representation…* and not *The demand curve is a representation…*

-   Double line break after every sentence. If the sentence is longer
    than 60 characters (whitespace included), add a double line break to
    separate the sentence. e.g. If a line is\
    *Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do
    eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.*\
    it should be type set as\
    *Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit,*\
    *sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna*\
    *aliqua.*

-   All mathematical symbols should be converted to text. e.g. *A times
    B* not *A x B*

## Sample Transcription

Filename Format:

Number of the video in the playlist, followed by the title of the video. e.g. *1 Why Rebut* for !<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5oW1ofFRgs>

For example, `1 Demand Curve.txt`

Text File Contents:

```
So now before I bore you with the things like

demand curve, supply curve,

consumer surplus and producer surplus,

let’s go into something simpler.

Everyone knows cookies.

You know cookie I know cookie,

I have a pack of cookies here.

Let’s say that the pack of cookies cost five dollars.

Now if it’s five dollars and you say:

"Hey the cookies are a little bit expensive,

I can’t afford that many cookies.

I’m just going to buy one pack of cookies."

So great. Imagine a graph.

The vertical axis being the price.

The horizontal axis being the quantity.

So what you do is that,

I say at 5 dollars, I buy one pack of cookies.

Now if I drop the price to 4 dollars,

Now 4 dollars I say:

"Hey maybe I can buy a little bit more cookies,

maybe my mom wants it,

maybe I want to eat a little bit more",

so you say I buy two packets.

If I lower the price a little bit more,

and I lower it to 3 dollars, I say:

"3 dollars. Right I’ll buy even more cookies",

so I’ll buy three packets.

I lower it to 2 dollars, you buy 4 packets.

I lower it to 1 dollar, you buy 5 packets.

Now, what you see happening is that on the graph,

you have 5 dots.

And these dots basically show the relationship

between the price and the quantity.

So in the next checkpoint,

you will see how these points

can be joined together to form the demand curve.

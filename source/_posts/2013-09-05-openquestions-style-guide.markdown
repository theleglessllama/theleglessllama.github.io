Adhere or perish! (Just kidding)

## How To Answer
Thank the person for asking us. After all, no one is asking them to use our service. It also helps us make them feel welcome! Remember, we're trying to build a community base.

Put your answer in brief in your first paragraph or first few lines. That way, people who're lazy to click ‘Continue Reading' can still get the gist of what's being written without delving into a potential wall of text.

Illustrate step by step how you arrive at the answer. Remember to signpost your answer - always link what you're saying to the previous step as well as its location in the thought process

Be Friendly! Place yourself in the reader's shoes. Use ``I'', ``You'', and ``We'' rather than the passive voice. Also check your tone for unintentional sarcasm - as a precaution.

Use original content where you can. If you're referring to a source, summarize it rather than just directing the person to the link.

If an OL lecture is available that provides the answer, or instruction in that direction, use and prioritize that.

If a question skews towards asking for an outright solution, provide less content and more hints. Guide the reader's train of thought and challenge them to think rather than providing them with the exact answer.

Try to gauge and answer at the level of the reader. If you're going in-depth, provide a simple answer first, then clearly tell the reader that you're getting down and dirty.

Never insert non-essential information that may not aid the reader's understanding of said concept. Knowing that a cat is furrier than other cats doesn't necessarily tell the reader that a cat is a cute pet.

Recall that in OL lectures, we checkpoint the lectures so that it becomes understandable. Same thing here – remember to checkpoint your answers, giving a brief so that readers know what you're writing in a particular paragraph.

Graphic illustrations of your own invention are also highly encouraged.

## Internal Triaging

Questions are to be triaged internally for the standard of the questions asked. The questions are to be triaged as follows:

1. Serious curriculum/academic work
2. Questions that ask for pure information
3. Crazy questions (ultra-high difficulty, think Olympiad level)
4. General inquiries
5. Troll questions (lowest priority)

This allows us to determine the urgency of the question, as well as the level of response required Use the following spectrum to decide how much of an answer should be given. The more the question skews toward asking for solutions, the less content and more hints should be given. 

## Quality Control

Remember to have these things in mind when you answer questions:

- Is it correct? We need to ensure that the content is correct! Make sure you know what you are doing when you are answering the question. Wikipedia and Google can be good resources for you to double check your information
- Is the level suitable? People come here to look for a quick fix, do not spam them with excessive information. The guideline is A levels, however, other concepts that are slightly above A levels can be brought in if it aids the understanding. Things -that are beyond A levels should be clearly labelled.
- Follow the guidelines for equations! Right now we are still writing equations in Facebook so before we work out a more elegant way of presenting them, follow the guidelines below.

### Formatting

- Basic English. If a question is poorly phrased when sent in, make it look presentable before posting it on the site. You don’t see aunt agony/submission columns on established sites posting up questions with broken English.
- No one wants to read a large chunk of text, keep it simple and in point form. It works the same ways as in the videos, we want bite-sized info!
- Proper, simple, understandable should be the maxim.

### Equations

As a rule of thumb, avoid LaTeX syntax until we get the LaTeX interpreter up. While it does make everything crystal clear, not everyone is familiar with LaTeX. So for now, we do everything linearly:

- Basic operations, ie addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, stick with the common symbols. For multiplication, use `x` only when there is NO variable `x` in the question. If there is, switch to the usage of brackets for multiplication (e.g. For 3 times 4x write `(3)(4x)` instead of `3x4x`)
- Exponential terms. `^` represents power, so `a^b` would be a to the power of b. Keep track of what in is the power term. If the exponential  has more than one term use brackets, e.g. `a^(b+c)`
- Logarithms. Any log taken to base 10, express it as `lg` and when it is base e, express it as `ln`. Simple. Now for a different base, for example for log of b taken to base a, write `log b (base a)`. Also, use brackets when you are trying to log more than one term.
- Fractions. Usually they can be represented by the simple divide sign, e.g. `a/b`. Just keep note of what's in the numerator and denominator when typing complicated fractions. For example, `(1-x)/y` is different from `1 - x/y`. So remember to use brackets when the numerator and/or the denominator has more than one term.
- Differentials. the simple `dy/dx` or `d/dx` approach should work. For specifying the differential at point, write it in this form: `dy/dx(x=a) = 10`
- Integration. Similarly, the simple `int` will represent the integration sign. Now to specify boundaries, put the limits in brackets. For example, `int(x)[2,3]` would mean integrates from `2-3`.
- Spaces. Try not the type whole equations out without any spaces.

### Chemical Formulae

- Do use the **IUPAC** naming for compounds to avoid confusion. However, trade names which are way more convenient for understanding are encouraged. (for example, `2,4,6-trinitromethylbenzene` is less preferable to `2,4,6-trinitrotoluene`)
- Write chemical formulae as if subscripts would be ignored - `C2H6` would be representative of $\ce{C2H6}$`, etc.
- `Ph` can be used to represent a Phenyl group (though do specify beforehand).
- Brackets should be used when describing appropriate substituent groups, like `CH3(Ph(NO2)3)` for trinitrotoluene $\ce{CH3(Ph(NO2)3)}$.

## Posting
- Posts should be verified by at least 1 more person before approval for publication
- Posts should be checked for:
	- Accuracy
	- Clarity and Coherence
	- Formatting and Language
- Publish status: **Yes (Y)**, **No (N)**, and **Pending (P)** are self-explanatory. Remember to assign them in the document so people are kept in the loop.
- When posting, adhere to the following guidelines:
	- Schedule posts every hour.
	- Hashtag the post appropriately - `#OQChem` for **Chemistry**, and so on and so forth.
	- Posts should be scheduled from **1800hrs** to **2300hrs** since page subscribers will probably receive the most airtime.

## Camera Software Setup

- Load [Marvel-Cine Picture Style](http://marvelsfilm.wordpress.com/marvels-cine-canon/) into the camera.
- (Optional) Capture using EOS Utility
	- Camera Settings/Remote Shooting > Live View
	- Focus > Quick Mode > Expand: AF Selection
	- Align the nose of the lecturer to the upper-right intersection point of the grid

## Lighting

- Three point lighting (or 4 point if you have enough space)
- Two in front of lecturer, two diffused to illuminate the background. 
	- The two in front should have 3 and 2 bulbs each.
	- The one behind should be lower power, diffused, to even out shadows on the green screen

## Sound

Assuming that you're using **Sennheiser XSW 12 Presentation Set**,

- Set sound level on the transmitte to -20dB or -30dB, depending on voice of the lecturer
- Make sure that the clip-on lapel mic is on the outside, not the inside of the lecturer's clothing
- Point the microphone at the direction of the lecturer's mouth
- Minmize the distance between the lecturer's mouth and the lapel mic
- Make sure that no piece of clothing or hair is in contact with the lapel mic. That creates fuzzy hisses. 

## For 5D MkIII


## For Rebel T4i

- Select the [Marvel-Cine Picture Style](http://marvelsfilm.wordpress.com/marvels-cine-canon/) **picture style** you have just loaded into the camera
- Set (Assuming you're using the 40mm f2.8 Pancake Lens)
	- ISO: 400
	- Shutter Speed: 40
	- Aperture: 5.6
- Set white balance to "White Fluorescent Light"
- Set recording format to 1080p, 30FPS
- Ensure that external microphone is plugged in, do a sound test to ensure that sound level hovers around the yellow level

## Positioning the Lecturer

- Position lecturer at the upper right third
- Tilt lecturer 30 degrees towards the lecturer's right such that he's asymmetric and facing the animations. 
- Ensure the Lecturer is cut off at around the diaphragm, and that he has sufficient space to move his hands

## Additional Tips

- Have bottles of water (or the lecturer's favorite drink) ready
- Have non-choking snacks (so no biscuits)
